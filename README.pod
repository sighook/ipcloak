=head1 NAME

ipcloak - cloak IPv4 addresses in alternate forms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ipcloak> <ip> [prefix] [postfix]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ipcloak> takes an IPv4 address in canonical dotted-decimal form and
renders it into multiple alternate numeric representations.

These representations exploit ambiguities and legacy behavior in IPv4
parsing across operating systems, standard libraries, and network-aware
applications. While modern specifications define a strict syntax, many
real-world parsers continue to accept non-canonical forms.

B<ipcloak> is intended for security researchers performing:

=over 2

=item *
Input validation and normalization testing

=item *
Filter and WAF evasion research

=item *
Parser behavior analysis

=item *
Educational demonstrations of protocol ambiguity

=back

The tool emits textual representations only and does not perform any
network activity.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<prefix>

Optional string printed before each cloaked output.

=item B<postfix>

Optional string printed after each cloaked output.

=back

=head1 FORMATS

Implemented forms:

=over 2

=item * Decimal integer

Whole 32-bit address as a single decimal number.

Example: 2130706433

=item * Hex integer

Whole 32-bit address as a single hexadecimal number.

Example: 0x7F000001

=item * Octal integer

Whole 32-bit address as a single octal number.

Example: 017700000001

=item * Per-octet hex/octal

Each octet rendered individually in hex or octal.

Example: 0x7F.0x00.0x00.0x01, 0177.0000.0000.0001

=item * Padded hybrids

Octets padded with leading zeros in hex or octal.

Example: 0x000000007F.0x0000000000.0x0000000000.0x0000000001

=item * Collapsed hybrids

Last two or three octets collapsed into a single integer (u16/u24).

Example: 0x7F.0x00.256, 0x7F.65536

=item * Mixed hybrids

Combinations of hex, octal, and decimal across octets.

Example: 0x7F.0x00.1, 0177.0.0.1

=back

=head1 FUTURE CLOAKS

Beyond the current forms, additional cloaks can be added to
improve bypassing and filter evasion.
These are not yet implemented, but documented here for roadmap
clarity:

=over 2

=item * IPv6-mapped IPv4

Represent IPv4 inside IPv6 notation.

Example: ::ffff:127.0.0.1

Many stacks normalize IPv6-mapped addresses back to IPv4, bypassing
filters that only check dotted-quad notation.

=item * Mixed-case hex

Accept both lowercase and uppercase hex prefixes.

Example: 0X7F000001

Case-insensitive parsers accept both, but regex filters often only
match lowercase "0x".

=item * Split dword forms

Break the 32-bit integer into two or more hex parts.

Example: 0x7F.0x00000001

Some parsers treat split integers as valid, confusing filters
expecting a single token.

=item * Whitespace padding

Addresses with trailing or leading spaces.

Example: "127.0.0.1 "

Lenient parsers trim whitespace, but filters may fail to normalize,
allowing bypass.

=item * Comment injection

Addresses with inline comments.

Example: 127.0.0.1/*foo*/

Regex-based filters often ignore comments, while parsers still resolve
the address.

=item * XOR-encoded cloaks

Obfuscate the dword with a key, then print the encoded integer.

Example (XOR key 0xFF): 2147483646

Used in shellcode obfuscation to reduce entropy and evade
signature-based detection.

=item * Array cloaks

Represent the IP as a sequence of smaller IPs or integers.

Example: [127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0]

Payload formed as multiple IPs can slip past filters expecting a
single canonical address.

=item * IPv6 short forms

Compressed IPv6 notation that still resolves to IPv4.

Example: ::7f00:1

IPv6 compression rules allow multiple equivalent encodings, confusing
simplistic validators.

=item * Overlong padded hex

Addresses padded with excessive leading zeros.

Example: 0x0000000000000000007F000001

Parsers accept padded hex, but filters may not normalize, enabling
bypass.

=back

=head1 EXTENDING

To add new cloaks, define a subroutine that returns a string
representation of the IP, then register it in @formats.

=head1 COLLAPSED FORMS

Some cloaks collapse octets into larger integers:

=over 2

=item * u16 = (octet3 << 8) | octet4

=item * u24 = (octet2 << 16) | (octet3 << 8) | octet4

=back

These match the original C program's "collapsed hybrid" outputs.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Render all cloaked forms of an address:

  ipcloak 127.0.0.1

Add markers around each output:

  ipcloak 192.168.100.1 "http://" "/endpoint"

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<inet_aton(3)>, L<inet_pton(3)>, RFC 791.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=over 2

=item *

Only IPv4 addresses are supported.

=item *

Acceptance of generated forms depends entirely on the target parser.

=item *

Modern, strict implementations may reject most non-canonical encodings.
